# DS_specialization_getting_and_cleaning_data
Assignment for DS specialization course - getting and cleaning data

This repo contains an R script that is used to clean and pre-process the smart watch dataset (accelerometer and gyroscope readings). Source data for this project can be found here --> http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## run_analysis.R  
The above script contains the R code that does the following tasks on the smart watch dataset.
	
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
